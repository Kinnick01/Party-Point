# Party Point
"where the party never ends!"

This project is a collaboration between multiple genius minds, trying to bring reality to the virtual world an vice versa.

## Our vision:
 to create an app/webpage where all the current musical and social events are held and easly visible for everyone within a 50 km rage of the users given location. Sorted as the users preferred music genre or sub genre.

## Setup the project:





## Naming conventions :

-When a ticket is assigned to you create a branch with the name of the ticket, and further branches form that branch, if other problems occur.

-Please have the courage create issues, and tickets, if you can't please notify an admin.

-All names should fall in the category of the problem, even if the problem has not been in the tickets. 

-While naming please watch out for duplication, if a duplicate instance occurs please notify the admin and track what is on the branch.
